# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the displayed/linked institute website domain to www.smartdesk7.com and add the uploaded pamphlet and image to the Home page.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the centralized institute details content to set the website as exactly `www.smartdesk7.com` so all references remain consistent.
- Ensure the website link in the Site Footer and on the Contact page opens `https://www.smartdesk7.com` in a new tab.
- Add the uploaded images (`SDPH-1.jpg` and `1000_F_755840623_3JuwWAI0IdvB5xOmCIqvUZmPyfLoHd3M-1.jpg`) as static frontend assets.
- Add a clearly labeled section on the Home page that displays both images with English alt text, responsive sizing, and a way to view them larger (e.g., open in new tab or modal/viewer).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the updated website domain link across the site, and can view the new Home page section containing the pamphlet and image (including on mobile and with an option to enlarge them).
